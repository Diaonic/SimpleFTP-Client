# SimpleFTP-Client
C# WPF FTP Client Implementation - Portfolio Project

The requirements for this project were simple. Build a WPF application that utilizes FTP to:
+ Upload a file
+ Download a file
+ Query the list of files from a directory
+ Support user authentication
+ Provide validation and error handling
+ A reasonable UI implementation

Along the way I implemented a logging system, file download progress tracker, handled exceptions such as invalid file names, connection errors, authentication issues. This tool was built in a short period and the purpose was to highlight some of my skills as a portfolio piece.
